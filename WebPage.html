			Background Story
		</h2>
		<h3 style="text-align:center">
			After your latest skydiving adventure, you happened to land on an island unknown to anyone on the plane.
			The plane flew on, leaving you on this island by yourself.
			To get back home, explore the island in search for the buried treasure.
			Once you find this, you will be able to offer it to the island inhabitants in return for a trip home.
			Interact with them to get hints on where to go and advice on how to get there.
			Beware of the animals in the jungle- make sure you have protection!
			Good luck!
